# Troubleshooting

Common failure modes when driving the `mercadona` CLI, and how to recover.

## Auth

**`not authenticated: …`** — no usable session. Seed a refresh token from one browser login:
`printf '%s' '<token>' | mercadona set-refresh --stdin` (token from DevTools → the `POST
/api/auth/tokens/` response, or local storage). For a quick one-off instead, `mercadona
import-curl --file session.txt`. Confirm with `whoami`. Note `mercadona login` won't work
headless — it needs a browser reCAPTCHA.

**`401 token_not_valid` / `whoami` fails after it used to work** — the access token expired
(~6-week life). With a seeded refresh token the CLI auto-refreshes and retries on its own; if
it still fails, the refresh token is also expired/rotated-away — do a fresh browser login and
re-seed it with `set-refresh`, or re-`import-curl`.

**`412` (or login just fails)** — reCAPTCHA Enterprise scored the request too low, typical from
datacenter/Cloud IPs. The first login must be a real *local* browser; don't try to headless it
or run it from Cloud Browser/serverless. Once a refresh token is seeded, this never matters again.

**"a cookie alone does not authenticate the API"** — the import had a cookie but no Bearer
token. The API authenticates with the token, not the cookie (the cookie is only Akamai
clearance). Re-copy an authenticated `…/api/customers/…` request that includes the
`authorization: Bearer …` header.

**`403`** on an authenticated call where the token looks valid — usually the `me` alias or a
customer-id mismatch; the CLI resolves the id from the token's `customer_uuid`, so re-import a
fresh session rather than passing `MERCADONA_CUSTOMER` by hand.

## Akamai / network

The auth + cart + checkout layer sits behind Akamai. At human-paced volume from a residential
IP it stays in monitor mode. If you see HTML challenge pages, `_abck=~-1~`, or sudden `403`s on
the authed layer:

- **Run from the user's residential IP**, not a datacenter/serverless egress (flagged IPs draw
  hard challenges). Reads/search are IP-independent; only auth/checkout are sensitive.
- Slow down — space out requests; don't hammer cart writes in a tight loop.
- As a last resort, mint fresh Akamai clearance by loading `tienda.mercadona.es` in a real
  browser on the *same IP*, then `import-curl` that session (token + fresh cookie).

Search runs against Algolia (not Akamai) and works from anywhere. If search starts failing
with DNS/`NXDOMAIN` or `401/403/404`, the Algolia app-id rotated — the CLI auto-rediscovers it
from the live SPA bundle and retries, so just run the command again.

## Product matching

**"no results" / wrong product** — Algolia relevance on a bare word is loose, and `batch`
only returns the top hit. Re-query with `mercadona search "<more specific term>" --limit 5`,
add brand/format words ("Hacendado", "1L", "sin lactosa"), or show the user options to choose
from. Don't trust `hit[0]` for anything the user was specific about.

**Right product, wrong price/availability, or a 404 on a known id** — you're in the wrong
warehouse. Ids and prices are per-warehouse; pass the user's `--wh` (e.g. `--wh bcn1`)
consistently across search, cart and checkout.

**A cart change didn't stick / a removed item reappeared** — the cart PUT carries no version,
so back-to-back `cart add`/`set` calls can race: the second reads the pre-change cart (backend
read lag) and overwrites the first. Re-issue the single change and verify with `cart get`; when
changing several lines, do them one at a time with a `cart get` between each, not in a burst.

## Checkout

**Minimum purchase error** — orders below **60€** are rejected (varies slightly by warehouse;
the bundle's "50" is not authoritative). Tell the user and offer to add items.

**No slots / all unavailable** — slots come from `checkout slots --address <id>`, not from
`checkout create`. If a day is full, check `available`/`open` on each slot and try another
address or day (`next_page` paginates).

**A prepared checkout is sitting unsubmitted** — that's the safe state. A `checkout create` +
`set-delivery` without `submit` reserves nothing irreversibly and costs nothing; it can be
left, replaced by a new checkout, or completed later. Only `submit --yes` places the order.
